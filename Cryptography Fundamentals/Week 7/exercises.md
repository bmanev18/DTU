  ### Show that this algorithm always terminates if $gcd(b1, b2) = 1$ and that its output is correct.

1. Termination:
    > An algorithm terminates if all its steps can be completed in a finite amount of time. All of the steps of the algorithm have finite steps of execution.

2. Correctness:
    > The algorithm has correct output iff. $gcd(b1, b2) = 1$ since it is an invariant for finding modular invers of $b1 \text{ mod } b2$.
